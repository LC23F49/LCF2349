<h3>Founder</h3>
<p>So Sharp Knife Sharpeners was founded in 1988 and lead by Mitch Bresette at the age of 42. Relying on hardwork, dedication, and cut-throat tatics, Founder Mitch Bresette quickly grew So Sharp from its humle beginnings to the knife-sharpening-based kitchenware megacorperation that it is today. Though some questioned his self-aware, self-described: "tyranical rule", any such worries were cast aside after working along side him and seeing how much work he has single-handedly doen for the company.</p>

<h3>Research & Development</h3>
<p>All the creative work at So Sharp is done by one man: David Hands. Coming up with products our customers will love and making them a reality is the fine work of Mr. Hands. So Sharp's name is even from the creative mind of Mr. Hands with the ingenius statement: "I mean knives are sharp so maybe we can do something with that for the name, I don't know Mitch I just think it's probably a better name than 'Mitch Bresette's Amazing Emporium of Magical Treasures', it doesn't even mention the fact that we only sell knife sharpeners. There's already a company called 'Sharp' so I guess we could be 'So Sharp'?" and ever since our company has been called by that name.</p>
<p>Mr. hands is also the head of our devlopment team responsible for such products as the "Very Sharp" Whetstone. We rely on Mr. Hands for his creativity and his adept ability to know what the customers want.</p>
